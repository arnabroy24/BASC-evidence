I need help refactoring a .NET project to .NET 10. Please follow this systematic approach:

## Step 1: Project Analysis
First, analyze the current project structure:
- Identify the current .NET version (either .NET Core 3 or .NET 7)
- Review all .csproj files to identify target frameworks, package references, and dependencies
- Scan the codebase for deprecated APIs, obsolete patterns, and framework-specific code
- List all NuGet packages and their versions
- Identify any custom middleware, startup configurations, or framework-specific implementations

## Step 2: Migration Planning
Create a migration plan that includes:
- Breaking changes between the current version and .NET 10
- Package upgrades required (with version compatibility)
- Code patterns that need updating
- API changes that affect the codebase
- Performance optimization opportunities in .NET 10

## Step 3: Refactoring Execution
Proceed with the refactoring in this order:

1. **Update project files (.csproj)**
   - Change TargetFramework to net10.0
   - Update all NuGet package references to .NET 10 compatible versions
   - Remove obsolete package references
   - Update SDK version if needed

2. **Update configuration files**
   - Modernize Program.cs and Startup.cs (if applicable) to .NET 10 patterns
   - Update appsettings.json if new configuration patterns are available
   - Update launchSettings.json for .NET 10

3. **Refactor code files**
   - Replace deprecated APIs with modern equivalents
   - Update using statements and namespace declarations to file-scoped namespaces (where appropriate)
   - Modernize code to use .NET 10 features (minimal APIs, global usings, etc.)
   - Update dependency injection patterns if needed
   - Refactor middleware and HTTP pipeline configuration

4. **Handle breaking changes**
   - Document each breaking change encountered
   - Provide the old code vs new code for my review
   - Explain why each change is necessary

## Step 4: Test Case Review
Regarding my existing QA tests:
- First, attempt to keep all existing test cases running with minimal changes
- Only refactor tests if they rely on deprecated testing patterns or frameworks
- If test refactoring is needed, clearly mark which tests were changed and why
- Ensure test coverage remains the same or improves
- Document any testing framework upgrades (e.g., xUnit, NUnit, MSTest versions)

## Step 5: Documentation
After refactoring, provide:
- A summary of all changes made
- List of deprecated features replaced
- New .NET 10 features leveraged
- Any potential performance improvements
- Migration checklist for verification
- Known issues or areas requiring manual review

## Important Guidelines
- Preserve existing functionality - this is a refactoring, not a rewrite
- Maintain code style and patterns unless they're deprecated
- Flag any changes that might affect runtime behavior
- Prioritize backward compatibility where possible
- Ask before making architectural changes

Please start by analyzing the project structure and current .NET version, then proceed step by step. Wait for my confirmation before executing large-scale changes.
